step-1: create pojo class
step-2: create java config file
step-3: Annotate java config file with @Configuration
step-4: create method inside java config file annotate with @Bean
        and give the return type of the class of which th object is being creating.
step-5: use AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(configFile_Location) and provide config file location.


--> @Configuration indicates that the class is spring configuration class.
--> It means that annotated java class contains bean definitions and configuration
    setting for the spring application context.
--> @Configuration allows us to define beans and their dependencies in Java-based
    wat instead of using xml configuration files.

--> In XML configuration, we provide an "id" attribute to specify the bean
    name, and we specify the "class" name using the class attribute.
--> In java configuration, the "method name" becomes the default bean name,
    and the "return type" of the method determine the class of the object that
    be created as the bean.

--> The @Bean annotation in spring is used to declare a method as a factory
    for creating and configuration a bean managed by the spring container.
--> The object created by the stdId() method, which is annotated with @Bean
    is managed and created by the spring container.
--> When the spring container initializes, it will invoke this method to
    create the Student object.

--> The method annotated with @Bean will:
      = Create a new Student object.
      = Configure the Student object, setting its properties using setxxx methods.
      = The default bean name for this method will be "stdId1", which is the same
        as the method name
      = Return the configured Student object.

--> The ApplicationContext (Spring Container) is an interface in Spring which is used
    to manage beans, handle application events, and access resources
--> Some implemented classes of ApplicationContext are:-
       1. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(used for XML configuration)
       2. AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(used for java configurations)

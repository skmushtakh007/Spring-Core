Autowiring:
Auto: Auto means automatically manages the connection between object.
Wiring: Wiring means linking those objects together to fulfil dependencies.
Autowiring can be achieved by:-
1. Annotation Based Autowiring (here we use @Autowired annotation)
2. XML Based Autowiring (here we use autowire attribute with modes)

1.@Autowiring:
= The @Autowired annotation in Spring is used for automatic  dependency injection.
= It tells spring: "Hey, just grab the right piece(bean) and plug it in here to make this work"
= In short, it simplifies your code by letting spring handle object connections for you.
@Qualifier: The @Qualifier annotation in spring helps in spring pick the
right bean among multiple beans of the same type. It helps spring to know
which bean you want injected, resolving ambiguity.
